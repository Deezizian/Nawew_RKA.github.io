In addition, I compete in archery and represent my nation as a member of the national team.
I'm 19 years old, and I reside in Baguio City on Ambuklao Road. I took up archery when I was twelve years old and was one of my decisions 
when I enrolled in Baguio City National High School's SPS program. This type of sport demands extraordinary accuracy and mental 
power, and it's also one of the reasons I'm at this place right now.</p>

As for my course, I chose IT because I really like technology and I also see myself doing it in the future.
Technology is really fascinating to me, seeing our world becoming more and more advanced as the world goes on.

I created this website because I wanted to share my love of technology with others. My goal is to create a website that will educate people about the various types of technology
about phones, laptops, audio gear and some DIY stuff like fixing phones and the such.
